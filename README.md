# Introduction 
This work proposed a new light-occlusion text entry method in MR environment that uses dual thumb typing on a touchscreen. In this work, we design a partially visible keyboard as visual feedback to improve user performance. In addition, we optimize the underlying keyboard by collecting eyes-free typing data through a user study. The results show that our method has high typing speed, low error rate, and is very novice-friendly.
